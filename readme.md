## 📊 Results and Visualizations 📊

The project generates several visualizations to better understand the dataset and model:

- *Pair Plots*: Showing the distribution of features by class.
- *Correlation Heatmap*: Displaying relationships between features.
- *Decision Tree Diagram*: Visual representation of the tree structure and decision rules.
- *Confusion Matrix*: Showing the performance of the classifier on test data.
- *Decision Boundary Plot*: Illustrating how the model classifies the feature space.

The optimized model typically achieves over 95% accuracy on the test set.

## 🤖 Model Details 🤖

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn. The model is optimized with parameters including:
- Criterion (Gini impurity or entropy)
- Maximum depth
- Minimum samples for split and leaf nodes

The best parameters are determined through grid search and cross-validation.
